## General Information
- The problem of the consumer finance company is that several customers have defaulted, and this leads to financial loss for the company.
- To solve this problem, the identification of such customers who are likely to default should be done before lending them loans.
- The aim is to identify patterns that indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is being used to find those variables/factors/patterns which can be an indicator of potential defaulters
- The provided dataset contains 39000+ records and 100+ variables.

<!-- As the libraries versions keep on changing, it is recommended to mention the version of library used in this project -->

## Conclusions
- Out of all the defaulters, the percentage of those who borrowed loan for debt consolidation is 49%, which is at least 4 times more than that of any other purposes.
- Among all the defaulters, those who have 0 to 3 years of experience and more than 10 years of experience combinedly become 47% of the defaulters.
- Number of verified defaulters, who have more than 10 years of experience and who have taken loan for debt consolidation, is at least three times more than any other employment length.
